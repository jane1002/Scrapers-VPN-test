Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman-Aceves, in San Francisco. Ms. Kahl observed that the determination of “indifference” rests on the valuation of the utilities’ portfolios, since Public Utilities Code §366.2(g) requires that the Commission reduce the portfolio cost by “the value of any benefits that remain with bundled service customers.” Ms. Kahl explained that the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) does not achieve indifference in valuing the bundled utility portfolios and, instead, shifts costs to departing load customers. Ms. Kahl noted that the APD’s attempt to equate the products in the utilities’ portfolios with the benchmark proxies produces a material cost shift to departing load customers.

Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Ms. Brandt discussed the need for the brown-power true up as required by D.18-10-019 to be implemented immediately in the PCIA rate update. Ms. Brandt expressed concern that the Energy Division RA Report that will be used to determine the capacity value in the PCIA benchmark does not reflect enough of the actual market transactions, nor are updates to the report frequent enough. Ms. Brandt suggested that requirements for what the report should include and when it is released may need to be codified in a future ERRA decision since it is used to set rates in the ERRA proceeding. Ms. Brandt further raised concerns about the timing of implementation of the PCIA decision in the ERRA, and about the interpretation of details that will need to be worked out for effective implementation.

Mr. Reardon noted that investor-owned utility shareholders should be subject to the risks and rewards of portfolio management decisions so that their incentives are aligned with those of ratepayers. Mr. Reardon emphasized the need to extract maximum value from existing contracts, and pointed to the California Community Choice Association’s voluntary buy-down and auction proposals as effective methods to achieve this.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M233/K836/233836254.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M233/K545/233545559.PDF""]"

Randolph, and on October 3, 2018, Ms. Sheriff met with David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman-Aceves, and Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen, in two separate meetings in San Francisco, and spoke by phone with Forest Kaser, advisor to Cmmr. Picker. Ms. Sheriff stated that CLECA has bundled members, Direct Access members, and members who are now served by Community Choice Aggregators, as well as some members with onsite renewable generation to serve a portion of their load. Ms. Sheriff explained that with this membership, CLECA always tries to be as evenhanded as possible for purposes of how the different types of customers are treated. Ms. Sheriff told that CLECA strongly supports the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD), especially its treatment of legacy Utility Owned Generation costs.  Ms. Sheriff asked for the APD to be revised to explicitly reject the Joint Utilities’ proposal for a new, non-vintaged charge. Ms. Sheriff explained that substantial evidence in the proceeding weighs against adoption of the Joint Utilities’ proposal to change the power charge indifference adjustment allocator. Ms. Sheriff explained that if the Commission seeks consistency in allocation factors for bundled and departing customers, it should direct the filing of Rate Design Window applications on this narrow issue – which will give notice to other parties. With Mr. Gamson and Ms. Shmidt, Ms. Sheriff also noted CLECA’s recommendation that the APD be revised to allow for a de minimis valuation for unsold, excess resource adequacy and renewables portfolio standard resources that remain in the investor owned utilities’ portfolios, as opposed to a zero valuation.

Mr. Balachandran made the case for including a greenhouse gas-free attribute to the market price benchmark. SVCE expressed support for the capacity benchmark described in California Community Choice Association’s (CalCCA) opening testimony, but requested that the Commission at least adopt the composite capacity benchmark proposed by CalCCA in its August 21 comments on the PD. Finally, SVCE requested that the final decision adopted by the Commission include more concrete guidance on the scope and schedule for Phase 2.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M230/K815/230815110.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M230/K886/230886846.PDF""]"

Peterman, in San Francisco. The AReM and DACC representatives discussed the impacts that each the Proposed Decision (PD) and Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) would have on Direct Access customers and Energy Service Providers, and stated a preference for the APD. In particular, the group discussed how the applicability of the legacy utility-owned generation costs for pre-2009 Vintage DA customers is already being addressed in A.16-04-018 et al and should be determined there; that the PD’s proposed treatment of legacy utility-owned generation costs in general might have unintended consequences; the PD’s revised market price benchmarks are not well defined, would be problematic, and that the use of the Renewable Energy Credit market index would be simpler, more accurate, more transparent and more predicable than the proposed RPS Adder. Further, the group expressed concern about the percent-based PCIA collar and discontinuation of the 10-year cost recovery rule that are proposed in the APD.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M229/K389/229389129.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M229/K414/229414371.PDF""]"

Guzman Aceves, and with James Ralph and Forest Kaser, advisors to Cmmr. Picker, in two separate meetings in San Francisco. At the second meeting, also present was Mitchell Shapson of the Legal Division. The discussion concerned the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) and EBCE’s perspective on the Proposed Decision (PD) and Alternate Proposed Decision (APD).  EBCE representatives pointed out that the utility narrative that bundled customers are bearing a significant cost shift under the current PCIA methodology is flawed; PG&E’s 2019 ERRA filing (A.18-06-001) shows bundled customer rates substantially declining and the PCIA for departed load customers going up significantly. EBCE representatives explained that the APD differs from the PD in material ways that would have catastrophic consequences for CCAs, and where the PD balanced changes that would benefit utilities with those that benefit CCAs, the APD makes changes that solely benefit utilities. EBCE representatives noted that both the PD and the APD create a cost shift onto CCAs by making the wrong changes to the capacity benchmark price. EBCE representatives explained that the APD will hinder achievement of the state’s energy goals.

Suzy Hong, Deputy City Attorney, San Francisco City Attorney’s Office, the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco) was also present. Ms. Hale described San Francisco’s Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program, CleanPowerSF, and the potential impacts on CleanPowerSF of the Proposed Decision (PD) and the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD). Ms. Hale discussed how San Francisco believes that the PD provides a reasonable transition to the longer-term solutions proposed for Phase 2 of this proceeding. Ms. Hale explained concerns with the APD and its potential negative impacts on CleanPowerSF’s program. Ms. Hale highlighted how these impacts would hinder San Francisco’s ability to meet the City’s and the state’s environmental goals. Ms. Hale and Mr. Ramirez discussed San Francisco’s positions on the PD’s and APD’s treatment of issues regarding pre-2002 legacy utility-owned generation (UOG), the 10-year limit on cost recovery for post-2002 non-RPS UOG resources, the value for the capacity benchmark in the PCIA calculation, and a PCIA rate cap and collar. Ms. Hale and Mr. Ramirez noted San Franciso’s support of the positions of the California Community Choice Association on these issues. With respect to legacy UOG and the 10-year limit on cost recovery for post-2002 resources, Ms. Hale emphasized the need to provide incentive to investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to prudently manage their portfolios and resources.

Peterman, and Mitchell Shapson of the Legal Division, and on September 5, 2018, with Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen Ms. Mitchell explained that San José is very concerned about providing an affordable base electricity product to its community. Ms. Solé explained that the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) would significantly jeopardize SJCE’s ability to launch its program and invest in long term renewable resources and the community through innovative customer programs. Ms. Solé explained that the APD is bad for all customers. Ms. Solé noted that the APD is not needed since PG&E’s rates are already going down. Ms. Solé explained that the APD undermines the ability of new CCAs to launch. Additionally, and only during the meeting with Yulia Shmidt, Ms. Solé explained that if 2002 utility-owned generation (UOG) are not excluded, it is all the more important to recognize the value of GHG-free resources. Ms. Solé also explained that it is critical to reflect the long-term value of capacity since the short-term market value of capacity in California is artificially depressed due to long-term planning.

EBCE stated that it supports the PD’s legal conclusion that pre-2002 legacy utility-owned generation (UOG) costs may not be included in the PCIA for Community Choice Aggregator (CCA) customers. EBCE stated its support for the PD’s provision for a “cap/collar” to mitigate the impact of changes in the PCIA. EBCE indicated its concerns with several aspects of the PD. EBCE recommended reforms to the capacity benchmark and the greenhouse gas free price; the cap/collar mechanism recommended in the PD in Phase I would serve as a bridge to keeping parties cost-neutral until we get through Phase II.

Peterman, and James Ralph, advisor to Cmmr. Picker, in two separate meetings; and on April 15, 2018, with David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves. All meetings were held in San Francisco. At the meetings with John Reynolds and James Ralph also present was Patrick Vanbeek, Vice President of Operations of Commercial Energy. Commercial Energy indicated its support for the concept in the Proposed Decision (PD) to commence a second phase of the case; however, Commercial Energy recommended that the Commission needs to provide the parties with both more specific guidance on the type of mechanism to be discussed and a limited time frame for the discussions. Commercial Energy recommended that the Commission ensure that RECs and RA attributes from the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) resources can be transferred to the LSEs. Commercial Energy also addressed the PCIA cap and collar established by the PD. Commercial Energy stated that the cap and annual maximum rate adjustment are too low. During the meetings with Mr. Ralph and Mr. Gamson, Ms. Somogyi stated that Commercial Energy favors the more flexible rate collar proposed in the Alternate PD. In the meetings with Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Ralph, Ms. Somogyi and Mr. Vanbeek discussed the new reporting requirements for ESPs established by the PD that would require ESPs to provide granular and highly sensitive contract information to the Commission to inform the RPS and RA benchmarks. Commercial Energy indicated that it is not aware of a statutory or other basis on which the Commission can require ESPs to divulge sensitive contract price information, and Commercial Energy believes that available market price indices can be used in lieu of ESP contract price data.

Joint Utilities Representatives discussed three major issues: (1) The Proposed Decision’s (PD) current treatment of Utility-Owned Generation (UOG) and energy storage resources; (2) the PD’s current PCIA “cost cap;” and (3) the PD’s PCIA “true-up” mechanism. Joint Utilities discussed how the current PD – if not modified – does not ensure bundled service customer indifference, as required by California statute. Joint Utilities Representatives discussed how the current PCIA “cost cap” is unreasonable and not equitable for bundled service customers. Joint Utilities explained the historical ratemaking treatment of UOG resources. Joint Utilities Representatives emphasized the need for additional clarity in the PD for the PCIA “true-up” mechanism.

Rechtschaffen, and on August 30, 2018, with John Reynolds, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman. Ms. Brandt and Mr. Edmister explained that the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) differs from the Proposed Decision (PD) in material ways that would have catastrophic consequences for Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs). Ms. Brandt and Mr. Edmister further noted EBCE’s concerns with the capacity valuation approach taken in both the PD and the APD. Ms. Brandt and Mr. Edmister stated that the APD will force numerous CCAs to at minimum fundamentally change their procurement practices, or at worst go out of business, the APD will do so by illegally and unfairly shifting costs from bundled to CCA customers.

Picker; on May 24, 2018, with Rachel Peterson and Joanna Gubman, advisors to Cmmr. Randolph; and on June 8, 2018, with Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen. Ms. Brandt provided EBCE’s perspective as a newer community choice aggregator (CCA). Ms. Brandt stated that the joint utilities’ GAM/PMM proposal does not adequately meet EBCE’s needs. Ms. Brandt explained that the joint utility proposal would force CCAs to buy the majority of their supply in the short-term market, since that is when supply would be made available to CCAs and the joint utility proposal does not guarantee delivery quantities. Ms. Brandt emphasized that it is important for the CPUC to provide stability to the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) framework in the short-term as it transitions to an equitable longer-term solution.  On August 10, 2018, Ms. Brandt had a telephone conversation with John Reynolds, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman, and had two separate meetings in San Francisco with Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen, and David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves. At the meeting with David Gamson also present were Evelyn Kahl, Counsel to CalCCA and Beth Vaughan, Executive Director for CalCCA. Ms. Brandt reiterated the legal and policy rationales that support the PD’s removing legacy utility-owned generation from the PCIA calculation. Ms. Brandt expressed concerns with the PD’s proposed true-up mechanism. During the meeting with David Gamson, written materials (attached to the notice) were used.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M224/K463/224463594.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M224/K423/224423179.PDF""]"

The Joint Utilities representatives discussed how the current Alternative Proposed Decision (APD) and PD – if not modified – do not ensure bundled service customer indifference, as required by California statute. The Joint Utilities discussed how the current PCIA “cost cap” is unreasonable, constitutes legal error, and is not equitable for bundled service customers, especially as set forth in the PD. The Joint Utilities stressed that the net costs of Utility-Owned Generation and mandated procurement must be shared equitably by all customers, and emphasized the need for additional clarity in the APD for the PCIA “true-up” mechanism, especially as it would apply to excess Renewable Energy Credits that the Joint Utilities were unable to sell.

At the meeting with Yulia Schmidt also present was Laura Martin of the Energy Division. POC representatives advocated that the $0.022/kilowatt hour per year cap on the power charge indifference adjustment (PCIA) should be a hard cap with no upward adjustment year-to-year. POC pointed-out that had the proposed decision (PD) disallowed avoidable solar and wind contract costs, in the specific case of SDG&E the (residential) PCIA would be approximately half the $0.021/kWh projected by the utility for 2018. POC noted that utility projections under current utility PCIA above-market calculation procedures indicate 2018 PCIA above market costs are at or near peak costs and these costs will decline going forward. POC expressed the opinion that utility concerns about rising above market solar and wind contract costs in future years should be addressed through securitization of existing solar and wind contracts, and not by allowing the PCIA cap to increase by as much as $0.005/kWh per year as currently proposed in the PD.

Mr. Day and Mr. Perry explained the Commercial Energy proposal entitled ""Voluntary Allocation & Auction Clearinghouse"" (VAAC), and the participants and methodology for conducting the allocation and then an auction of remaining utility Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA)-eligible resources. Mr. Perry explained that this model is based upon the successful allocation and auction procedure adopted by the Commission. Mr. Day and Mr. Perry explained that the VAAC auction would fix the cost of the winning bidder's portion of a generation pool, and at the same time fix the remaining PCIA costs associated with that resource. Mr. Day and Mr. Perry indicated that the Commission should combine useful recommendations from several parties in order to produce a comprehensive solution in the proceeding, including implementation of the VAAC allocation and auction procedures, together with the adoption of a residual PCIA recovery charge much like the final stage of the utilities' Portfolio Monetization Mechanism. Written material (attached to the notice) was used.

Peterman, in San Francisco. Also present were Mitchell Shapson, Attorney, CPUC, and Nathaniel Malcolm, Policy Counsel, Marin Clean Energy (MCE). MCE and SCPA argued that the Joint Utilities’ Green Allocation Mechanism (GAM) violates statute by allocating products instead of costs to Community Choice Aggregators (CCA).  MCE and SCPA emphasized they are already positioned to meet their respective long-term Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements and are projected to meet and exceed RPS requirements through 2030 without GAM allocations. MCE and SCPA also indicated that forcing MCE and SCPA to be excessively long on RPS would potentially bring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company well under RPS compliance. In this context, MCE and SCPA addressed the California Community Choice Association’s voluntary Staggered Portfolio Auction (SPA) as a way for all Load Serving Entities to acquire the RPS resources needed to serve their forecasted loads and meet, or voluntarily exceed RPS requirements. MCE and SCPA also noted that the GAM, unlike the SPA, would not provide CCAs the underlying energy associated with the allocated GAM Renewable Energy Credits.

Mr. Day and Mr. Vanbeek explained the Commercial Energy proposal entitled “Voluntary Allocation & Auction Clearinghouse” (VAAC), and the participants and methodology for conducting the allocation and then an auction of remaining utility Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA)-eligible resources. Mr. Day explained that this model is based upon the successful allocation and auction procedure adopted by the Commission. Mr. Day and Mr. Vanbeek indicated that the Commission should combine useful recommendations from several parties in order to produce a comprehensive solution in the proceeding, including implementation of the VAAC allocation and auction procedures, together with the adoption of a residual PCIA recovery charge much like the final stage of the utilities’ Portfolio Monetization Mechanism. Mr. Day and Mr. Vanbeek suggested that at the same time, the Commission should allow the parties to pursue initiatives that may take longer to complete.

Randolph. Nathaniel Malcolm, Policy Counsel, Marin Clean Energy (MCE), also participated in the communication. MCE and SCPA argued that the Joint Utilities’ Green Allocation Mechanism (GAM) violates statute by allocating products instead of costs to Community Choice Aggregators (CCA).  MCE and SCPA addressed the California Community Choice Association’s voluntary Staggered Portfolio Auction (SPA) as a way for all Load Serving Entities to acquire the RPS resources needed to serve their forecasted loads and meet, or voluntarily exceed RPS requirements. MCE and SCPA also noted that the GAM, unlike the SPA, would not provide CCAs the underlying energy associated with the allocated GAM Renewable Energy Credits. MCE and SCPA also indicated that they have no need for the Resource Adequacy (RA) allocations under the GAM. MCE and SCPA emphasized they are already positioned to meet their respective long-term Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements. MCE and SCPA indicated that forcing MCE and SCPA to be excessively long on RPS would potentially bring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company well under RPS compliance. MCE and SCPA challenged the Joint Utilities’ claims that the GAM is immediately implementable.

Also present were Greg Wade, City Manager of the City of Solana Beach (City) and Executive Director of SEA; and Dan King, Assistant City Manager of the City. Mr. Wade described Solana Beach’s efforts to develop a Community Choice Aggregation program in the City. Mr. Wade stated that SEA officially launched on June 1, 2018. Mr. Wade explained that the approval of the Green Allocation Mechanism (GAM) and the Portfolio Monetization Mechanism (PMM), proposed by the Investor Owned Utilities , would cause such a detriment to SEA that the program may be forced to close, upending the expectations of the citizens of Solana Beach and frustrating the efforts of the City to address climate change. From SEA’s perspective, Mr. Tosdal explained, the existing Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) framework, subject to modification, is the preferred option, and CalCCA’s proposals to bring down IOU portfolio costs that contribute to the PCIA – securitization and reverse auction – should be adopted.

Mr. Day and Mr. Perry explained the Commercial Energy proposal entitled “Voluntary Allocation & Auction Clearinghouse,” and the participants and methodology for conducting the allocation and then an auction of remaining utility Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA)-eligible resources. Mr. Perry explained the process by which the auction would fix the cost of the winning bidder's portion of a generation pool, and at the same time fix the remaining PCIA costs associated with that resource. Mr. Perry recounted his testimony in the proceeding. Mr. Day and Mr. Perry indicated that the Commission should combine useful recommendations from several parties in order to produce a comprehensive solution in the proceeding. Mr. Day and Mr. Perry explained that at the same time, the Commission should allow the parties to pursue forward sales of excess utility portfolio resources, along with securitization of utility owned generation and negotiated buy-outs or buy-downs of PCIA obligations.

Peterman, in San Francisco. Also present were Cynthia Clark of the University of California, George Waidelich of Albertsons and Chris Hendrix of Walmart representing Direct Access Customer Coalition (DACC), Mark Fulmer of MRW & Associates, consultant to AReM and DACC, and Dan Douglass, counsel to AReM and DACC, attended telephonically. Mr. Olson and Ms. Lynch explained that the allocation of Renewable Energy Credits and Resource Adequacy through the utilities’ GAM approach does not meet what other load-serving entities want and need. Mr. Fulmer described the elements of his testimony. Mr. Waidelich explained that DA customers desire energy cost stability and predictability and that the biggest impediment is the volatility and unpredictability of Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA). Mr. Waidelich recommended that the Commission should allow DA customers to pre-pay their PCIA obligation, based on a mutually acceptable forecast of that customer’s future PCIA obligation. Mr. Hendrix discussed the AReM/DACC proposal that the Commission should institute a cap on the PCIA. Mr. Fulmer clarified that there is already a “floor” in place and that adding a cap would create a “collar” where exposure of DA and bundled customers to volatility is more symmetric. Ms. Clark noted that DA customers in the current pre-2009 vintage tranche that have paid their stranded cost obligations should be permanently exempted from any PCIA or successor tariff.

Kahl noted that all discovery has been slower than originally anticipated by the Scoping Memo, that Southern California Edison has produced the data requested by CalCCA, that Pacific Gas and Electric Company posted a critical response to the PCIA forecast model on Friday, and that CalCCA is reviewing open items in coordination with the utilities. Kahl urged consideration of a six-week extension in the procedural schedule. Vaughan emphasized the critical importance of an extension under the circumstances to enable a fully informed discussion of issues.. Kahl noted that while CalCCA prefers to narrow issues through settlement, even with this extension there may not be sufficient time for meaningful settlement discussions.

Also present were Cynthia Clark of the University of California, George Waidelich of Albertsons and Chris Hendrix of Walmart representing Direct Access Customer Coalition (DACC), Mark Fulmer of MRW & Associates, consultant to AReM and DACC, and Dan Douglass, counsel to AReM and DACC, attended telephonically. Mr. Olson and Ms. Lynch explained that the allocation of Renewable Energy Credits and Resource Adequacy through the utilities’ GAM approach does not meet what other load-serving entities want and need. Mr. Fulmer described the elements of his testimony. Mr. Waidelich explained that DA customers desire energy cost stability and predictability and that the biggest impediment is the volatility and unpredictability of Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA). Mr. Waidelich recommended that the Commission should allow DA customers to pre-pay their PCIA obligation, based on a mutually acceptable forecast of that customer’s future PCIA obligation. Mr. Hendrix discussed the AReM/DACC proposal that the Commission should institute a cap on the PCIA. Mr. Fulmer clarified that there is already a “floor” in place and that adding a cap would create a “collar” where exposure of DA and bundled customers to volatility is more symmetric. Ms. Clark noted that DA customers in the current pre-2009 vintage tranche that have paid their stranded cost obligations should be permanently exempted from any PCIA or successor tariff.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M218/K401/218401829.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M218/K401/218401401.PDF""]"

Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Adenike Adeyeye, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves, and Kendall Helm, Vice President of Procurement of SDG&E, participated in the meeting by telephone. Referring to two options for Commission consideration of SDG&E’s proposed 59-month Resource Adequacy (RA) confirmation with the Otay Mesa Energy Center (OMEC), SDG&E clarified that the proposed RA confirmation does not impact the underlying contract and that the decision about whether or not to sell the plant to SDG&E, as provided in the original contract approved by the Commission, rests solely with the plant’s current owner. SDG&E addressed the Draft Resolutions’ descriptions of the net benefits analysis, clarifying that backstop procurement costs are likely to change over time and that altering assumptions to include insights from SDG&E’s recent Energy Resource Recovery Account filing or to allow for increases in net revenues in the future do not alter the finding that bundled customers are likely to capture net benefits under the term of the proposed confirmation. SDG&E emphasized that both bundled and departed/departing customers capture additional benefits through a shorter-term commitment to OMEC and the long-term optionality that results. SDG&E encouraged the Commission to vote out Option A.

The representatives of the Sierra Club and Union of Concerned Scientists requested that the Commission put an end to Southern California Gas Company’s (SoCalGas) use ratepayer funds to oppose needed electrification efforts across the state. Mr. Vespa referred to multiple examples of SoCalGas customer communications and policy advocacy activities that provided false and misleading information on building and transportation electrification to policy makers and the public. Mr. Vespa also discussed Sierra Club’s serious concerns with SoCalGas’ request to procure additional natural gas vehicles and to triple its current investment in natural gas refueling stations. Ms. Seel cautioned the Commission about permitting further investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. Ms. Seel referred to the testimony of The Utility Reform Network in this proceeding. Ms. Seel explained why the California Energy Commission should administer the entirety of the state’s natural gas research and development budget. Mr. Vespa asked the Commission to deny the $21 million request for application costs for the rejected North-South Pipeline. Written materials (attached to the notice) were used.

Guzman Aceves and Adenike Adeyeye, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves; and on December 6, 2018, met with Rachel Peterson, Anand Durvasula, and Suzanne Casazza, advisors to Cmmr. Randolph, in San Francisco. Sierra Club and UCS’s representatives focused on Sierra Club and UCS’s request that the Commission put an end to Southern California Gas Company’s (SoCalGas) use ratepayer funds to oppose needed electrification efforts across the state. Ms. Seel raised examples of SoCalGas customer communications and policy advocacy activities that provided false and misleading information on building and transportation electrification to policy makers and the public. Mr. Vespa emphasized that while such activities are to be expected from a fossil fuel company with a shareholder interest in maintaining demand for natural gas, they are a highly inappropriate use of ratepayer funds. Mr. Vespa also discussed Sierra Club’s serious concerns with SoCalGas’ request to procure additional natural gas vehicles and to triple its current investment in natural gas refueling stations. Ms. Seel additionally cautioned the Commission about permitting further investment in fossil fuel infrastructure like refueling stations at a time when the state is moving away from fossil fuels and these investments will soon be stranded. Mr. Vespa explained why the California Energy Commission should administer the entirety of the state’s natural gas research and development budget. Finally, Mr. Vespa asked the Commission to deny the $21 million request for application costs for the rejected North-South Pipeline.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M247/K696/247696571.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M248/K655/248655412.PDF""]"

Pedersen, attorney for the Southern California Publicly Owned Utilities (SCPOU) had a communication with Cmmr. Randolph at the Technical Workshop on the Aliso Canyon Scenarios Framework at the Simi Valley City Council Chambers, Simi Valley. The communication was during a period for comments on the Aliso Canyon hydraulic and economic modeling framework. Also present were Jean Spencer, Khaled Abdelaziz, Donald Brooks, and Mounir Fellahi of the Energy Division; Sabina Clorfeine and Jason Egan, attorneys, and other personnel, of the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas). Between 50 and 100 other persons were present during the communication, and an unknown number of persons, possibly including decisionmakers, viewed the webcast of the Workshop. In the course of his oral comments, Mr. Pedersen stated that an issue pending in this proceeding is whether core gas suppliers should balance daily deliveries of scheduled quantities to the SoCalGas system with actual daily consumption by the core customers served by the core gas suppliers. Mr. Pedersen explained that if core gas suppliers were permitted to continue to balance daily scheduled quantities to a daily forecast rather than actual core usage, the core suppliers could be deemed to be in balance within Operational Flow Order (“OFO”) tolerances even though their imbalances between scheduled quantities and actual consumption exceeded OFO tolerances. Mr. Pedersen observed that a question raised in the Update to the Scenarios Framework dated June 15, 2018 is the percentage utilization of “maximum available scheduling capacity.”  Mr. Pedersen also noted that issues related to trading of scheduled daily quantities are pending in the consolidated A.17-10-007 and A.17-10-008.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M252/K329/252329773.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M252/K521/252521731.PDF""]"

During the meeting, Ms. Wright discussed the voluntary changes that SoCalGas implemented to their gas reconnection process. Ms. Wright provided details regarding the manual scheduling process of all requests for reconnection of service following disconnection for nonpayment, and the commitment to offer a reconnection appointment no later than the next business day, with Saturday acting as a business day, or the second business day for requests made after 5pm on Saturday or on a Sunday. Ms. Wright discussed how this timing is comparable to other gas-only utility practices in the United States. Ms. Wright further discussed the scheduling of upcoming focus groups with customers. Ms. Wright and Ms. Kloberdanz-Yu discussed the more appropriate forum for addressing reconnection protocols. Ms. Wright and Ms. Kloberdanz-Yu further indicated that a motion seeking that relief was forthcoming in the active GRC proceeding.

"A1710007","213824402","February 14, 2018","EXPARTE","Coalition of California Utility Employees","Summary:  On February 12, 2018, Mila Buckner, attorney for Coalition of California Utility Employees (CUE), met with Maria Sotero, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Also present were Sarah Sharpe, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves; Edward Randolph, Director of the Energy Division, and Dorothy Duda, Franz Cheng, Dorris Chow and Eugene Cadenasso, Staff of the Energy Division; Phillip Enis and Risa Hernandez, Staff of the Consumer Protection and Enforcement Division; and Jerry Acosta, Javier Salas, and Belinda Moreno, representatives of UWUA. UWUA representatives explained the steps Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) takes when a customer fails to pay their bill and their gas service is shut off as well as what happens when a customer resolves an outstanding bill and requests that gas service be restored. Moreno explained that many customers do not realize they need to call SoCalGas and request that service be restored after they pay their bill. Moreno stated that customers who call in may experience long wait times or may struggle to reach a Spanish/Chinese speaking representative, and that for the past 5-10 years SoCalGas has failed to hire enough Customer Service Representatives to take these calls. Moreno stated that once a work order is placed, customers wait, on average, two weeks for their service to be restored. Salas and Acosta explained that SoCalGas has approximately 938 ETR and 130 ETRA employees who are qualified to restore gas service in a customer’s home. Salas and Acosta explained that while the utility has grown in size, SoCalGas has failed to hire an adequate number of employees to keep up with customer service demands.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M213/K824/213824402.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M214/K172/214172293.PDF""]"

Rechtschaffen, in San Francisco. Also present was Brian Cragg, outside counsel to IEP. Kelly pointed out that the Diablo Canyon retirement proceeding and the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) procurement plan proceeding provided the Commission with an opportunity to authorize procurement of renewable energy resources in time for the projects to qualify for the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) by 2019. Kelly emphasized that unless the Commission orders a solicitation for renewable resources in late 2017 or early 2018, the significant value of the tax incentives will be lost. Kelly noted that the timing of additional procurement of renewable energy is critical.  In the Diablo Canyon proceeding, IEP urged the Commission to direct Pacific Gas and Electric Company to conduct an all-source solicitation for up to 4,000 GWh by no later than July 2018. In the RPS procurement plan proceeding, IEP has urged the Commission to exercise the authority provided in Public Utilities Code section 399.15(bX3) and require jurisdictional load-serving entities to procure higher levels of renewable resources than the minimums specified in section 399. Written materials (attached to the notice) were used.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M198/K355/198355065.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M198/K354/198354864.PDF""]"

Pocta described the ratemaking portions of the proceeding including ORA’s recommendation that shareholders fund the “Community Impacts Mitigation Program.” ORA expressed its support of the settlement between Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, The Utility Reform Network, ORA and others that includes, for ratepayer funding, $18.6 million in license renewal costs, and excludes Allowance for Funds Under Construction for canceled capital projects. ORA discussed its opposition to PG&E’s request for ratepayer funding of the $1.3 billion “Tranche 1” replacement energy proposal as unjustified. Finally, ORA noted that it supports authorizing $160.5 million for employee retention payments that PG&E can allocate as it sees fit, but ORA does not support the excessively expensive plan PG&E wants customers to fund.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M197/K794/197794822.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M197/K875/197875485.PDF""]"

Rechtschaffen, Ehren Seybert, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman, David Peck, advisor to Cmmr. Picker, and David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves, in four separate meetings in San Francisco; and had a telephone communication with Jason Houck, advisor to Cmmr. Randolph. Shirley R. Edwards, Deputy County Counsel, Lin Ortega, Utilities Engineer/Program Manager, and Brad Vance, Utility Program Analyst, Facilities and Fleet Department, for CSC, and Jim Stone, Deputy Director of Operations, County of San Joaquin (CSJ), participated in each communication; and Steven Moss, consultant to CSC, participated in the meetings with Jason Houck, David Peck, and David Gamson. Ms. Trowbridge explained that CSC owns and operates several Renewable Energy Self-Generation Bill Credit Transfer (RES-BCT); CSJ is developing a RESBCT project, but it is on hold given the rate uncertainty posed by this proceeding. Ms. Trowbridge further explained that the Counties support the Proposed Decision’s (PD) recognition of the “essential differences” between the Net Energy Metering (“NEM”) program and the RESBCT program and its directive that Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) modify the TOU Settlement Agreement rate design for legacy RES-BCT customers. Ms. Trowbridge stated that the Counties believe further clarification is required regarding the methodology to be used to ensure an equitable result for legacy RES-BCT customers. Mr. Ortega explained the difference in NEM and RES-BCT net bill impacts. Mr. Ortega and Mr. Vance summarized the Counties’ proposal to apply a 6.2% net bill impact in 2023 for legacy RES-BCT customers. Mr. Ortega and Mr. Vance explained that PG&E’s analysis of what it believes to be an “equal treatment” methodology under the PD would result in a 26.5% net bill impact for legacy RES-BCT customers, and would render the Counties’ investments in their RES-BCT projects uneconomic during each year of the term of the TOU Settlement Agreement. Mr. Ortega and Mr. Vance further explained that PG&E’s proposal would result in solar credits valued below CSC’s investment repayment obligations. Mr. Stone and Ms. Edwards explained the County services benefiting from the RES-BCT program. Ms. Edwards and Ms. Trowbridge expressed the Counties’ support for the PD’s suggested treatment of legacy RES-BCT customers as complying with applicable law. In the meetings with Ms. Schmidt and Mr. Seybert, Ms. Trowbridge, Mr. Ortega and Mr. Vance clarified that if the pending Advice Letter cited in PG&E’s reply comments is approved, it would not make a meaningful difference in the net bill impact to legacy RES-BCT customers under PG&E’s proposal. In the meetings with Mr. Peck and Mr. Gamson, Mr. Moss clarified PG&E did not propose a process through which its proposed methodology would be evaluated, instead implying that its proposal would automatically be adopted as a tariff or its equivalent. In the meetings with Mr. Seybert, Mr. Peck, and Mr. Gamson, Ms. Trowbridge noted that the Counties believe their proposed methodology is also consistent with the guidance provided to affected parties in Southern California Edison Company’s Rate Design Window proceeding.

Picker, in San Francisco. The SEIA representatives discussed the Proposed Decision (PD) which was issued in on July 5, 2018. In particular, the SEIA representatives discussed the PD’s adoption, with modifications, SEIA’s Option S proposal for a storage-friendly rate for Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s Medium and large Light and Power customers. The SEIA representatives noted that a key feature of Option S is the innovation of a daily demand charge that applies during the 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. peak period to replace 80% of the non-coincident demand charges that apply 24 hours a day. The SEIA representatives stated that SEIA could accept the changes to its proposed Option S made in the PD, including basing the Option S daily demand charge based on 80% of the distribution non-coincident demand charges and capping the availability of Option S at 324 MW. The SEIA representatives talked about the relief afforded RES-BCT customers under the PD and supported the proposal made by the Counties of Santa Clara and San Joaquin in their comments on the Proposed Decision as to how to implement that relief.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M223/K633/223633526.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M223/K113/223113681.PDF""]"

TURN offered support for the Master Meter Discount methodology in the Proposed Decision of ALJ Doherty (PD) and urged the Commission not to make the changes proposed by the Western Manufactured Housing Association (WMA), including the elimination of the Diversity Benefit Adjustment and the use of residential class average costs to calculate the base discount. TURN also urged changes to the PD to remove the adoption of the marginal cost values proposed by Pacific Gas and Electric Company for purposes other than those expressly identified in the revenue allocation settlement. TURN expressed support for efforts to assist customers in hot, inland areas through the Family Energy Assistance rate program, adjustments to baseline quantities and other rate discounts. Mr. Freedman also pointed out that the residential rate settlement, which would be approved under the PD, reduces the baseline summer season to exclude the month of May. Mr. Freedman explained that this change benefits customers in hot climate zones by increasing the summer baseline allowance for the remaining months.

The SEIA representatives noted that a key feature of Option S is the innovation of a daily demand charge that applies during the 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. peak period to replace 80% of the non-coincident demand charges that apply 24 hours a day. The SEIA representatives stated that SEIA could accept the changes to its proposed Option S made in the PD, including basing the Option S daily demand charge based on 80% of the distribution non-coincident demand charges and capping the availability of Option S at 324 MW.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M223/K633/223633525.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M221/K866/221866152.PDF""]"

Charlyn Hook, Attorney, and Christopher Danforth, Analyst, for ORA, and Brandon Smithwood of the Solar Energy Industries Association (the Joint Parties) participated in both meetings.  The Joint Parties discussed their support for the Proposed Decision (PD) Identifying Fixed Cost Categories to be Included in a Fixed Charge.  The Joint Parties stated that the PD properly determined the categories of fixed costs that could be recovered in a fixed charge, consistent with the guidance developed in Decision (D.) 15-07-001 to limit fixed charges to customer-related costs. The Joint Parties noted that, while the PD did not adopt a methodology for determining fixed costs, it did achieve a careful balancing of included and excluded costs that the Joint Parties support.  The Joint Parties explained their position in the proceeding that the entire cost of the transformer, service and meter should be excluded from the fixed charge.  The Joint Parties provided some background and context on residential fixed charges, pointing out that Public Utilities Code § 739.9 authorizes, but does not require, the Commission to adopt a fixed charge for residential customers.  The Joint Parties described some history of fixed charges on utility bills, which have not been popular with customers.  Copies of the comments filed with the Commission, D.15-07-001 and Public Utilities Code § 739.9 were used during the meeting with advisors  to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves.

On August 29 and 30, 2017, Sidney Dietz, Director of Regulatory Relations for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), had three separate ex parte meetings in San Francisco.  On August 29, 2017, Dietz met with Ehren Seybert, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman, and David Peck, advisor to Cmmr. Picker, in two separate meetings; and on August 30, 2017, with Sean Simon, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen.  At the meeting with Ehren Seybert also present were John Reynolds, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman, and David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves.  Also present at all three meetings were Margot Everett, Senior Director of Rates and Regulatory Analytics, for PG&E; Brian Prusnek, Director of Regulatory Affairs for San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E); and Laura Genao, Director of Regulatory Affairs and Russ Garwicki, Director of Pricing Design and Research, for Southern California Edison Company (SCE).  Dietz stated that the proceeding was designed to decide what could be included in a fixed charge, but instead, the Proposed Decision (PD) prematurely limits consideration the costs of equipment that is fixed in nature.  Genao stated that the PD represents a complete departure from the Commission precedent by stating that service drops and final-line transformers are not fixed costs.  Genao further stated that the PD should identify what costs could be included in a fixed charge, not limit the CPUC’s ability to consider the costs for some types of equipment.  Everett stated that the PD moves the California away from a cost-causation model, which is reflected in precedent and in the goals of AB327. Garwicki described past proceedings where the CPUC, rather than decide how much of each piece of equipment contributed to fixed and variable costs, drew a conceptual line at the final transformer for customer costs and grid costs to be treated separately.  Prusnek stated that the PD creates an inconsistency among customer classes.  Everett stated that fixed charges, because of the cost categories involved, would apply to Community Choice Aggregation customers as well.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M195/K910/195910893.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M196/K087/196087404.PDF""]"

Peterman, and David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Also present were Neha Bazaj of the CPUC Energy Division; and Dennis Keane, Chief Regulatory Analyst, Rates and Regulatory Analytics, Deb Ghosh, Senior Manager, Electric Rates, and Phillip Quadrini, Expert Rate Analyst, Electric Rates, for PG&E. Citing to Figure 1 in PG&E’s January 31, 2018 Opening Comments Responding to Appendix B Questions, Mr. Keane stated that the effect of changing baselines has a nonlinear effect on bills – it increases bills for the lowest-usage and the highest-usage customers, but can lower or increase bills for other customers depending upon a variety of factors. Mr. Keane further stated that reducing rate differentials between tiers has a greater effect than baseline changes on high customer bills, as would the implementation of a fixed charge that lowered volumetric rates. Mr. Keane also described why implementing a fixed charge, even if the resulting revenue it collects only offsets the Tier 1 rate (as is the case when the rate ratios are defined relative to the composite Tier 1 rate rather than to the actual Tier 1 rate), still provides somewhat lower bills for upper-tier consuming customers. Mr. Keane stated that the current method for setting baseline quantities results in average rates that are approximately equal across all baseline territories. Mr. Keane and Mr. Quadrini stated that a more effective way to provide relief to Central Valley customers with high bills would be to implement a fixed charge, due to their significantly higher usage compared to other areas.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M216/K500/216500722.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M216/K500/216500942.PDF""]"

Picker, in San Francisco.  Also present were Christopher Danforth, Analyst, and Charlyn Hook, Attorney, for ORA, and Brandon Smithwood for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) (the Joint Parties).  The Joint Parties discussed their support for the Proposed Decision (PD) of Identifying Fixed Cost Categories to be Included in a Fixed Charge. The Joint Parties stated that the PD properly determined the categories of fixed costs that could be recovered in a fixed charge, consistent with the guidance developed in Decision 15-07-001 to limit fixed charges to customer-related costs.  The Joint Parties explained that the Joint Utilities’ proposal for including a host of costs in a fixed charge would result in increased costs for the smaller Tier 1 residential customers, adding to cumulative bill increases from tier flattening.  The Joint Parties explained how increasing revenue requirement recovery through a fixed charge and decreasing volumetric charges is contrary to state policy goals and dampens the price signal to conserve energy.  The Joint Parties also discussed the questions that were issued for the All-Party meeting on September 21, 2017. The Joint Parties discussed different ways that they could be answered, but stated that were unable to speculate on how different approaches asked about in the questions would affect the fixed charge.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M196/K144/196144635.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M196/K087/196087396.PDF""]"

"A1606013","196087408","August 03, 2017","EXPARTE","Pacific Gas and Electric Company","SUMMARY:  On July 31, 2017, Sidney Dietz, Director of Regulatory Relations for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), met with David Peck, advisor to Cmmr. Picker, in San Francisco.  Also present was Dennis Keane, Chief Rate Analyst, Rates and Regulatory Analytics, for PG&E.  Dietz stated that the petition to modify to allow an additional two-year grace period for PG&E’s non-residential customers to qualify for grandfathering on Time-of-Use (TOU) rates with obsolete TOU periods is not required for the health of the solar industry.  Keane described the concept and rationale for limited grandfathering of customers with solar, and noted that Decision 17-01-006 was a reasonable compromise that limited the amount of customer load allowed to be grandfathered on legacy TOU rates with outdated TOU period hours.  Keane also noted that PG&E has submitted comments stating it would not object to one additional proposed change to the grandfathering rules which would establish a somewhat-later installation deadline for schools.  Dietz stated that, while PG&E is supportive of this change to the decision, the additional grandfathering requested in the solar groups’ petition for modification is not warranted.  Keane stated that (a) PG&E has proposed, in its 2017 GRC Phase II case a 5 pm to 10 pm peak period for its non-residential TOU rate schedules, which are not expected to be implemented until 2019; (b) PG&E has proposed a 4 pm to 9 pm peak period for the upcoming residential default TOU pilot, which will commence in early 2018; and (c) PG&E will likely propose, in its upcoming 2018 Rate Design Window proceeding (that will be filed in December 2017), identical 4 pm to 9 pm peak period hours for the full roll-out of residential default TOU rates scheduled to begin in 2019.  Written materials (attached to the notice) were used.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M196/K087/196087408.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M196/K193/196193063.PDF""]"

Picker, in San Francisco.  The CCAs noted how this Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA) forecast application was unusual compared to other years’ ERRA forecast proceedings due to the substantial sales of energy and capacity that would occur in 2019 and due to the implementation of the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) decision, D.18-10-019. The CCAs discussed why the Commission should value multi-year sales of RPSeligible energy, RA capacity and brown power at the relevant benchmark for the purpose of forecasting the PCIA. The CCAs noted how PG&E’s approach to forecasting these non-resource specific sales contracts at the projected sales price does not comply with statute, the PCIA decision, other Commission precedent, the scope of the ERRA proceeding, or a reasonableness standard. The CCAs explained how PG&E’s modifications to the PCIA’s allocation factors are responsible for 56.5% of the increase in the PCIA between its September 7, 2018 Rebuttal Testimony and the November Update. The CCAs further explained how those modifications were not approved by D.18-10-019 and, therefore, should not be implemented in this ERRA. The CCAs urged the Commission to implement the brown power true-up for 2018 rates as soon as possible. The CCAs noted the on-going transparency issues in the ERRA where few of the issues in PG&E’s prepared, rebuttal and updated testimony, including the substantial shifts in policy represented therein, are clearly explained.

Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Ms. Brandt discussed the need for the brown-power true up as required by D.18-10-019 to be implemented immediately in the PCIA rate update. Ms. Brandt expressed concern that the Energy Division RA Report that will be used to determine the capacity value in the PCIA benchmark does not reflect enough of the actual market transactions, nor are updates to the report frequent enough. Ms. Brandt suggested that requirements for what the report should include and when it is released may need to be codified in a future ERRA decision since it is used to set rates in the ERRA proceeding. Ms. Brandt further raised concerns about the timing of implementation of the PCIA decision in the ERRA, and about the interpretation of details that will need to be worked out for effective implementation.

Ms. Mitchell and Ms. Priego attended the meeting via telephone. The CCAs representatives discussed the revised Proposed Decision’s (PD). SJCE described the high housing costs in San Jose and the large proportion of disadvantaged residents in the city. SJCE explained that it will start serving residential and commercial customers in February 2019. SJCE stressed the importance of a fair and timely outcome in the Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA). The CCAs urged the Commission to implement the brown power true-up for the “target year” 2018 in 2019 rates. The CCAs pointed out how their request to true up brown power costs first follows directly from D.18-10-019. The CCAs referred to a January 4, 2019, ex parte notice by Peninsula Clean Energy and East Bay Community Energy for details on how the language in the PD should be changed to clarify the brown power true up. The CCAs described the on-going transparency issues in the ERRA.

SCE representatives discussed Demand Response (DR) and how it can be used to help low-income customers, disadvantaged communities (DAC), and transmission-constrained local areas, particularly as customers are transitioned to time-of use rates. SCE raised the potential of working with Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in the DR Pilot. SCE suggested that it could use its expertise to identify low-income customers that could benefit by shifting their load, and further its education and outreach training with CBOs to help educate customers about time-of-use rates, thermostat settings, and available DR programs. SCE further discussed its commitment to align its marketing, education, and outreach campaigns across the low income, DR, and residential rate reform proceedings.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M215/K848/215848240.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M215/K851/215851418.PDF""]"

Picker before the California Senate Energy, Utilities, and Communications Subcommittee on Gas, Electric and Transportation Safety, at Santa Rosa City Hall. Elizaveta Malashenko, Director of the Commission’s Safety and Enforcement Division, and Nidhi Thakar, advisor to Cmmr. Picker, were also present. It is SCE’s understanding that Cmmr. Picker departed the hearing prior to Mr. Herrington’s panel. The hearing addressed utility wildfire prevention and response. Mr. Herrington provided an overview of SCE’s response to the recent wildfires and mudslide in California. Mr. Herrington stressed that it is imperative that the State improve fire safety by taking immediate action to implement clear State standards for critical infrastructure, developing smarter policies around building structures in high-risk fire areas, and executing a state-coordinated funding strategy to effectively address fire prevention and fire suppression. Mr. Herrington explained that when wildfires occur, the State needs a new approach to allocating costs so the financial risk is appropriately shared and insurance coverage remains affordable. Mr. Herrington also discussed that SCE uses a risk-based approach to assessing financial investments in its electric infrastructure that prioritizes safety.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M216/K258/216258534.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M215/K914/215914720.PDF""]"

Picker, in San Francisco. Also present were Lorene Miller, Managing Director, Customer Service Re-Platform Project (CS Re-Platform), and Laura Genao, Managing Director, Regulatory Affairs, for SCE. At the meeting, SCE representatives discussed the interplay between CS Re-Platform and SCE’s roll-out of residential default Time-Of-Use (TOU) rates. SCE addressed issues associated with the timing of SCE’s TOU roll-out and CS Re-Platform implementation. SCE discussed the potential Marketing, Education, and Outreach impacts of additional time required for SCE to fully complete the TOU roll-out, and SCE explained how the old and new systems can accommodate customers being transitioned at different times. SCE also discussed the impacts that certain elements of TOU roll-out (such as bill protection) can have on the timing of system implementation. Written material (attached to the notice) was used.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M207/K891/207891399.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M206/K664/206664046.PDF""]"

On April 26, 2017, Morad Fakhrai, Director of Public Works of the City of Hayward (City), met with David Peck, advisor to Cmmr. Picker, in San Francisco.  Also present was Kevin Briggs, Acting Assistant City Engineer for the City.  City staff discussed the proposed decision (PD) and the alternate proposed decision (APD) as they relate to the Rule 20A program.  City staff agrees with the determination in both decisions that Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) should create a balancing account for Rule 20A funds and that an audit of PG&E's Rule 20A program is necessary.  City staff expressed support for the determination in the PD that the Rule 20A allocations should return to the 2010 level.  City staff disapproved the determination in the APD that the Rule 20A allocation should remain at the 2011 GRC determined levels but later during the meeting agreed that a return to a ""tariff based calculation"" of the allocation level would also be supportable.  City staff stressed its opinion that undergrounded electrical facilities are safer than overhead electrical facilities.  City staff discussed the difficulty that reduced allocation levels create and how very difficult it is for cities to accumulate enough work credits to include undergrounding with any significant Capital Improvement Project.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M195/K146/195146381.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M195/K544/195544460.PDF""]"

Cmmr. Picker also testified at the hearing, but was not present during Mr. Hogan’s testimony. However, PG&E believes that Nidhi Thakar, advisor to Cmmr. Picker, was present when Mr. Hogan made his opening remarks. The topic of the hearing was wildfire prevention and response. Mr. Hogan began his opening remarks expressing his heartfelt sympathies to the thousands of families affected by last year’s fires. Mr. Hogan stated that in light of this reality, it is incumbent on us all to work together, to continue to evolve our prevention and response efforts and to develop best practices and solutions for the evolving conditions of our new normal. Mr. Hogan noted that in defining best practices, we need to keep in mind that each utility’s service territory has different risks, based on environment, weather, vegetation, terrain, population density and other factors, and what may be an appropriate practice for one utility may not be for another. Mr. Hogan described PG&E’s key prevention and response programs. Mr. Hogan closed by emphasizing that PG&E is ready to work with stakeholders.

The parties representatives discussed their concerns regarding the position that has been taken by the investor owned utilities (IOU) regarding the confidentiality of distribution system planning data. The parties representatives discussed how such a broad interpretation of what is confidential makes it very difficult to craft a non-disclosure agreement that creates workable provisions for parties to operate under, especially as it exposes the recipient of information to potential liability for revealing information that is in fact already in the public domain.

The Joint IOUs representatives discussed security issues regarding the public availability of the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and Renewable Auction Mechanism (RAM) maps. PG&E stated that it has been observing cyber security threats to its PV RAM map data which has been increasing since the issue was first deliberated upon in 2011. The Joint IOUs noted that they were interested in protecting the grid by limiting bad actors from obtaining the information and had no intention of limiting access to verified good actors. The Joint IOUs proposed to require users of the maps to register on a secure web portal and sign a non-disclosure agreement which does not deviate from the norm adopted by the Commission and other stakeholders for other security-sensitive and confidential information. The Joint IOUs noted that restricting access to PV Maps would be consistent with other more recent actions taken by the Commission and the approach by other state and federal agencies. The Joint IOUs sought updated protocols from the CPUC contemplating cyber and physical security risks and proposed a short-term interim solution.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M234/K963/234963071.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M235/K193/235193823.PDF""]"

Guzman Aceves, and on April 20, 2018, with Ehren Seybert, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman, in San Francisco. At the meetings also present were Christian Knierim, Public Utilities Regulatory Analyst, and Matt Miley, Staff Attorney, for the ORA. At the meeting with Candace Morey also present was Christopher Myers, Public Utilities Regulatory Analyst, for the ORA. During both meetings, ORA discussed the proposed Decision Denying the Application of Southern California Edison (PD), which was issued in Application (A.) 16-11-002. ORA noted that Southern California Edison Company (SCE) asks the Commission to take judicial notice of the California Energy Commission’s (CEC) California Energy Demand (CED) Update Forecast 2016-2027 and CED [Revised] Forecast 2018-2030 for the alleged factual truth that the PRP RFO 2 resources may be needed to address a load increase of approximately 720 MW in the Western Los Angeles (LA) Basin by 2021. ORA asserted that that factual matter is in dispute and by law, judicial notice should not be granted. ORA pointed out that the CEC’s CED forecasts do not focus on the Western LA Basin, but rather the entire LA Basin. ORA discussed relevant information regarding one of the contracts that SCE claims will support its Distribution Resources Plan (DRP) Demonstration Projects (Demo) C in Rulemaking 14-08-013 et al. ORA explained that the record does not support the purported viability of one of the contracts for the purposes of Demo C. In the meeting with Ehren Seybert, ORA also discussed several claims made in a letter in support of SCE’s Application that was served on the service list for A.16-11-002 on April 20, 2018 by the non-party Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M219/K472/219472350.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M219/K473/219473982.PDF""]"

(Sunrun), met with Rachel Peterson, Anand Durvasula, and Joanna Gubman, advisors to Cmmr. Randolph, in San Francisco. Sunrun representatives emphasized that behind-the-meter (BTM) storage providers can benefit all utility customers by providing substantial clean, local and customer-driven capacity in ways that can meet various grid services needs such as resource adequacy (RA) and distribution deferral. Sunrun explained that several policy barriers are restraining the ability for this capacity to be cost-effectively provided to the market. Sunrun clarified that the nearest term way to allow for BTM storage systems to be aggregated and deliver additional valuable energy services is to ensure that exports from BTM storage systems qualify for RA capacity credit. Sunrun supported collaboration between the Commission and the California Independent System Operation (CAISO) to modify the CAISO’s Proxy Demand Response market mechanism to allow for exports or changes in the RA rules. Sunrun stated that it would also support load modification constructs that would allow exports to reduce a load serving entity’s RA obligation. Sunrun generally discussed other concerns encountered in recent grid services solicitations.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M268/K722/268722575.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M268/K444/268444761.PDF""]"

ORA also discussed two Notices of Ex Parte Communication that were recently filed in A.16-11-002 by entities that are not parties to that proceeding: (1) the notice filed by Convergent Energy and Power, LP on April 2, 2018 (Convergent Notice), and (2) the notice filed by Swell Energy Inc. on April 3, 2018 (Swell Notice). ORA emphasized that the Convergent Notice and the Swell Notice do not indicate that their respective “Comments” on the Proposed Decision were not accepted by the Commission’s Docket Office and, therefore, are not part of the record of the proceeding. ORA stated that it finds this activity to be misleading to the Commission and the public. Written material (attached to the notice) was used.

SCE noted that there were several contracts in the PRP RFO2 application SCE planned to use in its DRP demonstration projects. Specifically, for Demonstration C, designed to test the locational net benefits analysis methodology, SCE stated that it believes successful implementation of the project relies upon timely approval of a certain PRP contract. For Demonstration D, which is designed to study high DER penetration levels, SCE stated that it intends to use the PRP contracts to significantly augment the DER penetration in the study area. Finally, SCE stated that it believed leveraging PRP RFO2 contracts to reduce DRP procurement needs was the right thing to do, and noted the Commission’s own expression of appreciation for this approach in the DRP Track 2 Demo C and D decision issued in February.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M215/K367/215367130.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M215/K365/215365349.PDF""]"

Florio during their morning commute on the ferry from Alameda to San Francisco.  Dr. Fine discussed broadly the progress made by the Integrated Capacity Analysis (ICA)/Local Net Benefits Analysis (LNBA) working groups, the fact that the working groups need to be diligent in following processes for establishing “consensus” positions that allow enough time for meaningful comment by stakeholders, and the fact that utility methodologies for ICA and LNBA need further refinement. In addition, Dr. Fine touched on EDF’s work in Fresno with the Rocky Mountain Institute Electricity Lab, Integrated Distributed Energy Resource utility revenue pilot and EDF’s alternative to that pilot, and the recent ruling in New York on utility business models.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M163/K155/163155658.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M163/K152/163152771.PDF""]"

"R1503011","158297916","January 06, 2016","EXPARTE","Marin Clean Energy","SUMMARY:  On January 4, 2016, Jeremy Waen, Senior Regulatory Analyst for Marin Clean Energy (MCE), met with Ehren Seybert, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman, in San Francisco.  Also present was CC Song, Regulatory Analyst for MCE.  MCE representatives voiced concerns regarding the language within the Proposed Decision which would continue to limit SGIP-funded ES deployment to only being countable towards the Investor-Owned Utilities' (IOUs) ES procurement targets. MCE expressed its concern that the continued prohibition of Community Choice Aggregator's (CCAs) abilities to count SGIP-funded ES deployment towards their procurement targets, would likely lead to stagnation in the development of customer-side ES market segment. MCE reminded the Commission of MCE's collaboration with the College of Marin and Tesla Motors Inc. to install on-site ES. MCE representatives stated this resource will be located on the premises of a MCE customer within MCE's service territory, yet MCE is not presently able to claim credit for the development of this resource towards its ES procurement target, per Decision 13-10-040. MCE staff questioned whether there may still be a middle-ground solution that would allow both IOUs and CCAs to count of SGIP-funded ES resources towards their procurement targets.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M158/K297/158297916.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M158/K194/158194439.PDF""]"

Also present at the first meeting were Mitchell Shapson of the Legal Division and Diana Lee, attorney for the ORA, and at the second meeting - Marion Peleo, attorney for the ORA. The ORA discussed the May 31, 2018 revised proposed decision, in particular the Mountain View Generating Station outage, the reasonable manager standard, and Southern California Edison’s (SCE) nondelegable duty for harm caused by its contractor. ORA indicated that the revised proposed decision correctly holds SCE liable for the negligence of its contractors, and that ORA supports the revised proposed decision’s disallowance regarding the Mountain View outage. At the second meeting, ORA representatives also stated that, as discussed in ORA’s briefs, SCE should provide additional metrics or a supplemental narrative to demonstrate the accuracy of its load and price forecasts, and that there should be an independent review of SCE’s forecasting and modeling tools.

SCE’s representatives discussed the Revised Proposed Decision (Revised PD) pending in this proceeding. SCE’s representatives expressed concerns with the procedural fashion in which Revised PD was issued. SCE also discussed how the Revised PD’s findings regarding the Record Period outage at Mountainview Generating Station are inconsistent with previous Commission precedent and could have negative unintentional consequences if not modified. SCE noted that for Utility-Owned Generation outages the appropriate standard of review is the reasonable manager standard, not a perfection standard. SCE also observed that the line of cases imposing liability on utilities for the actions of their contractors beginning with the Snyder decision was limited to instances where there were violations of non-delegable safety-related duties. SCE explained that Commission rules do not provide that a utility must be held vicariously liable for mistakes made by its vendor.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M215/K366/215366929.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M215/K366/215366804.PDF""]"

Ms. Sheriff stated EPUC's support for the Proposed Decision's (PD) rejection of the boutique Option R rate and recommended adoption of the PD. Sheriff reiterated the recommendation in EPUC testimony that the Commission consider establishing a separate customer class for customers with solar Page 2 -EPUC generation, with their own allocation of costs and rate design specific to such customers' cost-causative characteristics.

Guzman-Aceves, in San Francisco.  Also present was Mona Tierney-Lloyd, Senior Director, Western Regulatory Affairs, for EnerNOC.  Myers referred to the Joint DR Parties’ Opening Comments on the Proposed Decision (PD) Adopting 2018 Local and Flexible Capacity Obligations and Refining Resource Adequacy (RA) Program.  Myers indicated that the Joint DR Parties supported certain outcomes reached by the PD. However, Myers advised that the Joint DR Parties remained disappointed that their Phase 3 proposals, in particular, examination of a 2-hour resource qualifying for RA and the unbundling of flexible RA from system and local RA either did not call for direct study by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) or was not addressed at all. Myers stated that the Joint DR Parties had requested specific modification to the PD to address those concerns.  Tierney-Lloyd indicated that the Joint DR Parties were concerned with the language used in the PD related to a proposal by Southern California Edison Company to count resources that can respond within 20 minutes toward a local capacity RA requirement.  Tierney-Lloyd explained that the issue of the merits of a 20 minute response time for qualifying RA was still being studied, and any action by the Commission that would seem to approve a proposal requiring such a response time was either premature or could prejudge the outcome of that study. Tierney-Lloyd further stated that, to avoid a quotation (from D.16-05-045) at page 22 of the Proposed Decision being taken out of context, that language should be modified to reference the entire discussion on this point.  Tierney-Lloyd identified the Joint DR Parties’ concerns with the CAISO’s efforts to propose changes to the RA Availability Assessment Hours through the CAISO’s Business Practice Management change process in its Proposed Revision Request 986.  Tierney-Lloyd noted that the CAISO indicated that it was going to file a one-time wavier of its tariff for 2018; however, the Joint DR Parties’ concerns remained.

Peterman, in San Francisco.  Also present were James Caldwell, Consultant, and Sara Steck Myers, Attorney, for CEERT.  Myers discussed CEERT’s comments on the Proposed Decision (PD) Adopting Local and Flexible Capacity Obligations for 2018 and Refining the Resource Adequacy Program.  Myers stated that CEERT appreciated the PD taking into consideration of CEERT’s concerns. However, Myers advised that CEERT believes that there are issues that remain that should be addressed as soon as possible – either in this PD or in the next Resource Adequacy (RA) rulemaking.  Caldwell stated that now is the time for RA to move more quickly. Sara Steck Myers stated that the Commission may want to consider having a different RA cycle or issuing a mid-term Decision to ensure that important issues related to needed refinement in the RA process are actually fully addressed, rather than leaving them to the June RA Decision, in which time may not permit their resolution.  Caldwell addressed the lack of transparency with RA.  Caldwell also stated concerns about the fact that the Energy Division’s 2015 RA Report had not been issued until January 2017, and it remains unclear about what resources were used to support which functions.  Caldwell also explained that, as to system RA, phasing in Effective Load Carrying Capacity (ELCC) is a mistake.  Caldwell urged the Commission to move forward now to adopt ELCC without further phasing.  As for flexible RA, Caldwell stated that the current process was not working to ensure procurement of resources that meet a flexible need. Caldwell recommended either dropping the program altogether and relying on energy and ancillary service markets or redefining the flexible RA metric.

Long and Woodruff referenced TURN’s previously filed June 14, 2017 opening comments on the pending Proposed Decision (PD).  TURN referred to Table 1 of its PD comments, and discussed two corrections to all three methodologies that are needed. The TURN representatives explained the adjustments to the PD’s adopted methodology that are necessary to correct these errors, as shown in Tables 2 and 3 of TURN’s PD comments, and that TURN’s corrections would reduce the cost to ratepayers by $31 million.  The TURN representatives also explained TURN’s position that, if the PD were modified to adopt a different ELCC methodology that yielded higher RA costs, the Commission should phase in 50% of the higher RA requirements in the first year, in order to avoid unnecessarily sudden cost impacts and changes to the RA markets.  The TURN representatives indicated TURN’s support for public reporting of forward procurement data, consistent with confidentiality requirements.  The TURN representatives stated that TURN agrees with the PD’s determination not to adopt a multi-year RA requirement at this time.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M195/K910/195910530.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M195/K910/195910821.PDF""]"

Rechtschaffen, in San Francisco.  Also present was Brian Cragg, outside counsel to IEP.  Kelly noted that the Proposed Decision (PD) again proposed to defer a decision on the issue of a multi-year forward reporting or procurement obligation for Resource Adequacy (RA) capacity.  Kelly explained that resolution of this issue at this time is particularly critical.  Kelly and Cragg described IEP’s proposal to establish a multi-year forward framework for RA capacity.  Kelly observed that the two Energy Division staff reports on RA capacity have been helpful, but they have not been issued regularly and the results are somewhat stale by the time the reports are issued.  Kelly noted that IEP’s multi-year reporting requirement would be integrated with the annual RA capacity showings that load-serving entities already make.  Kelly recommended that the PD should be modified to establish a Phase 4 for this proceeding to complete its evaluation of the multi-year forward proposals by the end of this year.  Written materials (attached to the notice) were used.","[""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M195/K911/195911236.PDF"",""https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M195/K910/195910687.PDF""]"

Also present was Delphine Hou, External Affairs Manager, CAISO. Doughty provided background information on a proposed revision request (PRR) to the CAISO's Business Practice Manual for Reliability. Doughty explained CAISO submitted this PRR to clarify that demand response resources should be available in 20 minutes to meet reliability standards that require the system operator to return the system to a normal state within 30 minutes after a first contingency. Doughty and Hou explained that the 20-minute standard was developed after the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station  outage. Doughty and Hou clarified the 20-minute response time did not represent a change from past CAISO local technical studies.
